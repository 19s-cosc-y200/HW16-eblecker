    <p > 
        Prices vary based on materials used and quantity. 
        For example bracelets made with glass beads are significantly cheaper than those made with semi-precious stones.
        Prices for bracelets are typically between $5 to $20, and necklaces are typically between $10 and $30.
        There is no extra fee for made-to-order bracelets, however, they will take longer to ship.
